# Australian-Trade-Analysis-Dashboard

## **Project Overview**
This Tableau dashboard explores the Australia International Trade dataset, which was extracted from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Globalisation has significantly impacted the world, creating interdependent economies, and Australia is no exception. The dataset represents import and export data from 1988 to 2022, showcasing Australia's involvement in global trade across various commodities.

The dataset contains 10 main categories and 67 subcategories, expressed in Australian millions, which include:

* Food and live animals
* Beverages and Tobacco
* Crude materials, inedible, except fuels
* Mineral fuels, lubricants, and related materials
* Animal and vegetable oils, fats, and waxes
* Chemicals and related products
* Manufactured goods classified chiefly by material
* Machinery and transport equipment
* Miscellaneous manufactured articles
* Commodities and transactions not classified elsewhere in the SITC
  
The goal of this dashboard is to uncover and highlight key trends in Australia's international trade through advanced visualization techniques, such as data storyboards and visual storyboards.

## **Main Findings**

Below is the 1st storyboard from the Tableau dashboard. The entire interactive dashboard can be viewed/downloaded: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shriyans.vallam/viz/AustralianTradeAnalysisDashboard/StoryPoint3

* As seen in the figure above, the total dollar value of Australia's exports and imports have increased exponentially over the 34-year period
* The dollar value of exports increased by 1314.29% while the dollar value of imports grew by 829.86% over the 34-year period
* Total exports decreased from $222 bliion in 2008 to $197 billion in 2009 due to the Global Financial Crisis

* Although the average dollar value of both exports and imports of Food and Live animals has consistently increased over the 34-year period, the proportion of this category relative to Australia's total trade has declined


**Below is the 3rd storyboard**

* The biggest proportion of Food and Live Animal exports is cereals and cereal preperations as well as meat and meat preperations. Historically, Australia has always been a large exporter of beef and lamb and with China's increased demand for livestock, exports of meat have remained consistently high

* Following the GFC, exports of diary products and fish have consistenly decreased, accounting for only 8% of total exports

**Story Board 5**

* The figure above shows additional information regarding the sub-category changes
* Australia's imports of Food and Live animals mainly consist of miscellaneous edible products, vegetables and fruits, and cofee and various spices. The primary reason behind this is a combination of satisfying consumer demand and the inability to grow certain spices and vegetables in Australia's harsh climate
